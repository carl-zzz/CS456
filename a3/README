(from Hanzhang Chen 20574275)

Written with Python. Tested in ubuntu server.

Finished all parts of assignment.

For this assignment, I tried to use concurrent design instead of single-thread design which is a bit tough to write. SocketServer module is used in server. 

## Server Design ##
Basic idea for server is using handle class in socketserver to realize concurrency. A buffer is created which can contain one payload for each key.
	- uploader should wait if there is still a value in the buffer dict with coresponding key
	- downloader should wait if there is no value in the buffer dict with coresponding key
After finishing uploading or downloading, key records will be cleaned in order to save space. 

## Client Design ##
Basic design for client, as in a1 and a2(just input has more cases, send the 9-byte controll msg first).
