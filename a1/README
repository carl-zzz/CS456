CS456 A1

Written with Python3. Test in ubuntu server.

Finished all parts of assignment.

Two versions written. One with send/connect, the other with sendto. 

Sendto version has been preserved. 



Experiment 1
	- With sendto version, no package loss has been detected. 
	- With send/connect version, package loss founded. 
		-python3 receiver /dev/null 5000
			31535
			5046 645888
		-python3 sender ubuntu1604-006 31535 128 1000000
			7813 1000000
		indicates loss.
	conclusion:
		with the same file size(large size), the smaller payload size is, the more loss packages have been found.

Experiment 2
	-terminated by timeout
		python3 receiver /dev/null 5000
			52784
			56274 56274
		python3 sender ubuntu1604-006 52784 1 1000000
			1000000 1000000
		time out. (with sendto version)
	-terminated by ending
		python3 receiver /dev/null 5000
			48378
			1 100
		python3 sender ubuntu1604-006 48378 2048 testfile   // testfile contains 100 bytes
			1 100
		finishing safe and sound.

Experiment 3
	-using the example in assignment desciption.
	-time ./sender ubuntu1604-006 57321 16 1000000
	result:
		62499 1000000

		real 0m52.649s
		user 0m1.040s
		sys 0m1.572s
	usertime and systime are just almost the same.
